# Data Storage System 🐱‍💻
A program created to practice the JSON module. You can insert details of a user like their name and age along with a passcode which is used to edit the details. 
All this information is stored into a json file. The only problem is that you need to create a file manually with the name 'exercise.json'. However, the updated program has already been built with the name 'Profile System'.

## Required Packages 💻
Json & Time

## Future Plans 🪐
No new plans, as an updated version of this project has been already uploaded.
